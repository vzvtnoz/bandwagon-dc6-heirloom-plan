# BandwagonHost DC6 CN2 GIA "Heirloom" Plan Back in Stock: $46.59/Year for 1 Core/512MB RAM/1Gbps@500GB – Multiple Premium Locations Available

---

Something genuinely surprising just happened – a legendary plan that vanished back in 2020 is suddenly available again. We're talking about the DC6 CN2 GIA VPS, a plan that first appeared in 2019 and quietly disappeared mid-2020. Right now, you can grab it for $49.99 annually, or $46.59 with the current discount code.

Why does this matter? Because this is currently the lowest entry point into BandwagonHost's premium CN2 GIA network. You get seamless migration between multiple top-tier data centers including DC6, DC9, Japan Softbank, Netherlands AS9929, and Canada CN2 GIA. If you've been waiting for an affordable way to experience genuine premium routing, this might be your moment.

## The Basics: What You're Actually Getting

Let's cut through the marketing speak. Here's what this plan includes:

**Core Specifications:**
- 1 CPU core
- 512MB RAM
- 10GB SSD storage
- 1Gbps network port
- 500GB monthly bandwidth
- Annual billing: $49.99 ($46.59 after discount)

The hardware specs look modest on paper – and they are. This isn't a powerhouse meant for hosting your entire business infrastructure. Think of it more like a Swiss Army knife: compact, efficient, good at specific tasks.

What makes it interesting isn't the raw specs. It's the network routing and data center flexibility.

## Why People Actually Want This Plan

Here's the thing about CN2 GIA routing – it's not just marketing jargon. The practical difference shows up when you're actually using the server.

Regular routing means your data bounces around unpredictably, sometimes taking bizarre detours through congested nodes. CN2 GIA gives you dedicated premium routes with fewer hops and better stability. For users connecting from China or Asia, this translates to noticeably faster response times and more consistent performance.

The mobile network takes a direct route on the outbound path, which matters if you're dealing with Chinese mobile users. China Telecom and China Unicom get the full CN2 GIA treatment both ways.

Now, we're not saying this turns a budget VPS into a dedicated server. But the routing quality punches above what you'd expect at this price point. When network congestion hits during peak hours, premium routing actually makes a difference.

The difference becomes obvious once you experience it firsthand.

## The Data Center Situation

This is where things get more interesting than usual. You're not locked into one location – the plan includes free migration between several premium data centers:

**DC6 CN2 GIA-E (Los Angeles):** The main location, solid all-around performance
**DC9 CN2 GIA (Los Angeles):** Alternative LA location with CN2 GIA routing  
**Japan Softbank:** Lower latency for Asian users, though bandwidth costs more there
**Netherlands AS9929:** China Unicom premium routing to Europe
**Canada CN2 GIA:** Another option if you need North American presence

The migration tool works smoothly – no complicated tickets or waiting periods. You literally just click a button, wait a few minutes, and you're running in a different data center. Same IP? No, you get a new one. But for most use cases, that's a minor inconvenience compared to the flexibility.

Why would you switch? Maybe Japan's latency looks better for your specific users. Maybe you want to test how the Netherlands route performs compared to US-based routing. Or maybe you just want to experiment. The point is, you can.

## What This Plan Actually Works For

Let's be realistic about use cases. With 512MB RAM, you're not running memory-hungry applications. But there's plenty this plan handles well:

**Personal VPN/Proxy:** The most common use case. The routing quality matters more than raw power here. Works smoothly for daily browsing and streaming.

**Lightweight Web Services:** Small personal blogs, API endpoints, simple web apps. Don't expect to handle thousands of concurrent users, but modest traffic runs fine.

**Development and Testing:** Great for trying out configurations, testing deployments, or learning server administration without significant investment.

**Network Testing:** If you're evaluating routing quality before committing to higher-tier plans, this gives you real hands-on experience with CN2 GIA performance.

What it doesn't work for: Database-heavy applications, video transcoding, anything requiring serious computational power, or high-traffic production websites. The specs simply aren't there.

## The "Limited Edition" Reality Check

BandwagonHost calls this a "Limited Edition" plan. That terminology sounds like marketing, but there's some truth to it. This specific configuration disappeared for years before reappearing now. When it sells out, it might vanish again for an extended period.

Does "limited" mean it'll sell out in hours? Probably not. BandwagonHost tends to stock these reasonably. But it does mean they don't maintain continuous availability like their standard plans. When inventory runs out, you might wait months (or years, apparently) before seeing it again.

The practical takeaway: If you're seriously considering it, don't assume you can think about it for weeks and come back later. These heritage plans have a track record of appearing and disappearing unpredictably.

## Bandwidth and Traffic Considerations

500GB monthly bandwidth at 1Gbps sounds like a lot until you actually think about use patterns. For typical VPN usage or hosting a low-traffic website, you probably won't hit the limit. But streaming video constantly or downloading large files regularly? You could run through it faster than expected.

The 1Gbps port speed matters more than you'd think. Even with the bandwidth cap, that burst speed means your actual user experience feels snappy. Downloads start fast, pages load quickly, and there's no annoying throttling sensation during normal use.

If you exceed your bandwidth allocation, BandwagonHost doesn't immediately shut you down. The overage charges are clearly documented in their terms, but for most users running typical workloads, staying under 500GB isn't difficult.

## Free Backup and Snapshots

This might sound mundane, but automated backups and free snapshots are genuinely useful features that some providers charge extra for.

The automatic backup system runs regularly without you thinking about it. If something breaks during an experiment or update, you're not starting from scratch. The snapshot feature lets you save specific states before making changes – incredibly handy when you're testing configurations or trying new software.

These aren't massive features that change everything, but they're the kind of practical conveniences that make server management less stressful. You can actually experiment and learn without constant anxiety about breaking everything permanently.

## Setting Realistic Expectations

Here's what this plan isn't: It's not a miracle solution that replaces expensive dedicated servers. It's not going to handle enterprise workloads. It won't magically solve all latency issues for global users.

What it actually is: An affordable entry point into premium routing infrastructure with surprising flexibility for the price. It works well for specific use cases where routing quality matters more than raw computational power.

The value proposition depends entirely on what you need. For someone who primarily cares about consistent Asia-Pacific connectivity and wants the flexibility to test different data centers, this plan offers legitimately good value at $46.59 annually.

For someone who needs serious processing power, lots of RAM, or massive bandwidth, this isn't the right fit – and that's okay. Not every plan needs to serve every use case.

## Conclusion

The DC6 CN2 GIA "heirloom" plan's return feels like finding something you'd written off as permanently unavailable. At $46.59 per year, it remains the most accessible way to experience BandwagonHost's premium routing infrastructure. The multi-location flexibility, automated backups, and free migration tools add practical value beyond just the base specifications.

Is it perfect? No – the modest specs mean you need realistic expectations about what it can handle. But for personal VPN use, lightweight hosting, or evaluating routing quality before committing to higher-tier plans, it offers a surprisingly capable foundation. The real question isn't whether it's objectively the "best" VPS available, but whether its specific combination of premium routing and data center flexibility matches what you actually need. If you've been curious about [why BandwagonHost's CN2 GIA network consistently delivers better Asia-Pacific performance](https://bandwagonhost.com/aff.php?aff=79616), this plan lets you experience it firsthand without a major financial commitment.
